In this exercise, you will bring it all together by chaining async requests.
1) In the file getPost.js, write a function that chains together the two async functions you have previously written, so that you make a POST request to the /animal route, and then retrieve the data with a GET request to the /all path.

You should pass in a data object of your favorite animal as the second argument for the POST request.

Call your function as the last line of code in the file named getPost.js.

 SOLUTION

function postGet(){
  postData('/animal', {fav:'lion'})
    .then(function(data){
      retrieveData('/all')
    })
}

postGet()
