Exercise: Fixing Functionality
Let's get your app working properly again! Start by cding into webpack-sass.

Update the webpack config output to include libraryTarget and library
HIDE SOLUTION
Add the below in webpack.dev.js.


output: {
    libraryTarget: 'var',
    library: 'Client'
},
Update your Javascript to use the Client package created by webpack
HIDE SOLUTION
Add the below in the client's index.js file.


export {
    checkForName,
    handleSubmit
}
Then, in the views directory, in index.html, update the references to handleSubmit to Client.handleSubmit.

Lastly, in the client/js directory, in formHandler.js, update to checkForName(formText).

You do not need to change the server port for the classroom workspace.
Make sure all functionality on the page works as expected. You should both be able to enter one of the captain names in client/js/nameChecker.js and get a new alert, as well as the Form Results on the app showing "this is a message".
